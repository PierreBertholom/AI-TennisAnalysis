# AI Tennis Analysis

This project aims to analyze a tennis match from a 24 fps video and measure various metrics, such as player speed, ball speed, and more. It also includes a mini-court representation showing the ball and the players. The project detects players and the tennis ball using YOLO models and utilizes CNNs to extract keypoints from the court.

## Demonstration

Below are some GIFs demonstrating the output of the AI Tennis Analysis project:

## Potential Improvements

While this project provides a good foundation, there are several potential improvements and updates that could enhance its accuracy and functionality:

**Homography for Keypoints:** Implementing homography to accurately map the court's keypoints can improve the precision of the players' and ball's positions on the mini-court.
**Enhanced Metric Calculations:** Developing more sophisticated algorithms for calculating metrics like player speed, ball speed, and distance covered can provide more accurate and insightful data.
